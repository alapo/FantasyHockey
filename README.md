# FantasyHockey

# This is a repository of a fantasy hockey tool I have made.

# The program FH2016.py imports the two CSV files of players stats at different points in the season, and produces a graph of how their Gpg, Apg, and SOGpg have changed over the season.

# The program then conducts a ranking of players and prints it to the command. Users can then search for a specific player to find their ranking (note that because the player groups have been filtered for only players with a certain amount of GP and PTSpg, not every player in the league will appear).

# Take a look at ExampleGraph.GIF and ExampleRanking.GIF for what the output looks like.
